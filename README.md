## A little about me...
- 👋 Hi, I’m @johnyarbi.  If curiosity killed the cat, then I'm glad I'm not a cat.  I had a quote in high school that I like to think I came up with which said "I consider myself a student of life.  I live to learn, and while doing so, I learn to live."  That holds true to this day.
- 👨‍💼 I am an entrepreneur and have founded or co-founded a few companies over the years, including P-Net Computer Solutions (defunct), Renewed Wellness LLC (active), and EXP4 LLC (active).  EXP4 LLC is my latest endevour and gives me a legitimate way to offer consulting and other professional services to clients.  I also have numerous other pet projects in varying stages, including Abstract Intellect, YarbiSoft, InsertLife, IKnowBut, and several under the Y1 umbrella like Y1Ventures, Y1IS, and Y1Labs.
- 👀 I’m interested in things that are interesting.  Sounds like a lame answer but anything can be presented in a way that makes it interesting.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning applied data science through MIT Professional Education.  Among other things, the course focuses on Python, machine learning, neural networks, recommendation systems, time series databases, data analysis and visualization with a strong emphasis on linear algebra, discreet mathematics, and statistics.  The programming aspect of the course is the easy part... I quickly realized how long it has been since I took a statistics class though.  I'm also sharpening my skills on other languages, frameworks, and methodologies.  Learning never ends.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on automation projects for IoT applications, crypto and traditional asset performance analysis, machine learning/artificial intelligence applications, and distributed monitoring systems.  Really anything that is presented to me as interesting.
