- 👋 Hi, I’m @johnyarbi
- 👀 I’m interested in things that are interesting.  Sounds like a lame answer but anything can be presented in a way that makes it interesting.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning applied data science through MIT Professional Education.  Among other things, the course focuses on Python, machine learning, neural networks, recommendation systems, time series databases, data analysis and visualization.  I'm also sharpening my skills on other languages, frameworks, and methodologies.  Learning never ends.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on automation projects for IoT applications, crypto and traditional asset performance analysis, machine learning/artificial intelligence applications, and distributed monitoring systems.
