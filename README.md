# Nice to meet you!
If you were redirected to this page by visiting experienced.pro (or another domain), welcome!  You're in the right place!  I'm still working through shaping the vision for that initiative, along with several others, but there are only so many hours in a day for pet projects.  Right now, I'm focused on my career with [Momentus Technologies](https://gomomentus.com), my family, and continuing to build and run the businesses I've already started.  I'm always interested in meeting new people (like-minded or otherwise) so feel free to reach out and strike up a conversation.

## A little about me...
- üëã Hi, I‚Äôm @johnyarbi.  If curiosity killed the cat, well... I'm glad I'm not a cat.  I had a quote in high school (which I like to think I actually came up with) that said "I consider myself a student of life.  I live to learn, and while doing so, I learn to live."  The modern term for this is "life-long learner" but the mantra holds true to this day.
- üë®‚Äçüíº I am an entrepreneur and have founded or co-founded a few companies over the years, including P-Net Computer Solutions (1999-2000), Y1Ventures Property Management (2015-2022), Renewed Wellness LLC (2021, active), and EXP4 LLC (2022, active).  EXP4 LLC is my latest endevour and gives me a legitimate way to offer consulting and other professional services to clients.  I also have numerous other pet projects in varying stages, including experienced.pro, Abstract Intellect, YarbiSoft, InsertLife, IKnowBut, and several under the Y1 umbrella like Y1Ventures, Y1IS, and Y1Labs.  In my free time, I also enjoy working with my hands doing light home renovation, light car/motorcycle maintenance/repair, creating loops/beats, and escaping reality with the occasional video game (Minecraft/Beat Saber).
- üëÄ I‚Äôm interested in... things that are interesting.  Sounds like a lame cop-out answer but I've found that anything can be presented in a way that makes it interesting.  I'm what most would call a "generalist", but unlike the stereotypical "jack of all trades, master of none" who has a shallow base of knowledge on a wide range of topics, I tend to go deep on whatever piques my interest and have managed to build a lot of subject matter expertise across numerous areas over the years.  I'm not sure that I would call myself a "master" in any one area, but my former bosses have called me a "unicorn", a "wizard", and even reffered to me as "the Krakken" becuase they always knew they could throw me into any situation without thinking twice.
- üå± My current focus is working on some integrations with Azure Logic Apps (for Jira/SharePoint), building Power BI dataflows/datasets/reports to get better data from our existing systems, and studying up on the SAFe (Scaled Agile Framework) flavor of Agile.  I also recently completed a course in applied data science through MIT Professional Education.  Among other things, the course focused on Python, machine learning, neural networks, recommendation systems, time series databases, data analysis and visualization with a strong emphasis on linear algebra, discreet mathematics, and statistics.  The programming aspect of the course is the easy part... I quickly realized how long it has been since I took a statistics class though.  Thankfully, they make libraries and functions to help with that.  I'm also sharpening my skills on other languages, frameworks, and methodologies.  Learning never ends.
- ü§ù While I'm not actively focusing on any specific side project, I'm always open to meeting and collaborating with others.  If something here has caught your attention, reach out!  I'm looking to collaborate on some mechanical engineering/renewable energy ideas I've been mulling over for a while now and want to prototype, exploring automation projects for IoT applications, crypto and traditional asset performance analysis, machine learning/artificial intelligence applications, and distributed monitoring systems.  Really anything that is presented to me as interesting or with a fresh prespective.
