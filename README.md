# Nice to meet you!
If you were redirected to this page by visiting [experienced.pro](http://experienced.pro) (or another domain), you're in the right place!  Leaving the professional persona on [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/johnyarbi), this space is a little more... me.  Yeah, this is my space üòÅ  I'm always interested in meeting new people (like-minded or otherwise) so feel free to reach out and strike up a conversation.

## A little about me...
- üëã Hi, I‚Äôm @johnyarbi.  If curiosity killed the cat, well... let's just say I'm glad to be human.  My favorite quote in high school (which I like to think I actually came up with) was "I consider myself a student of life.  I live to learn, and while doing so, I learn to live."  The modern term for this is _life-long learner_ but the mantra holds true to this day.
- üëÄ I‚Äôm interested in... things that are interesting.  Sounds like a lame cop-out answer but I've found that anything can be presented in a way that makes it interesting.  I'm what most would call a _generalist_, but unlike the stereotypical "jack of all trades, master of none" who has a shallow base of knowledge on a wide range of topics, I tend to go deep on whatever piques my interest and have managed to build a lot of subject matter expertise in several domains over the years.  I'm not sure that I would call myself a "master" in any one area because I know there is always more to learn, but my former bosses have called me a "unicorn", a "wizard", and even reffered to me as "the Krakken" becuase they always knew they could throw me into any situation without thinking twice and my generalist knowledge would help me adapt and put the pieces together quickly to take decisive action.
- üë®‚Äçüíº I am [#opentowork](https://linkedin.com/in/johnyarbi).  My most recent "real job" was with Momentus Technologies where I was the Technical Product Manager for the Shared Platform and Ecosystem, focusing on modernizing the integration experience and re-imaging reporting and analytics.  I am also an entrepreneur and have founded or co-founded a few companies over the years, including P-Net Computer Solutions (1999-2000), Yarbi Properties (2015-2022), [Renewed Wellness LLC](https://renewed-wellness.com) (2021-present), and [EXP4 LLC](https://www.exp4.us) (2022-present).  EXP4 LLC is my latest endevour and enables me to offer consulting and other professional services if the right opportunities come up.  In my time away from a keyboard, I also enjoy working with my hands doing light home renovation, light car/motorcycle maintenance/repair, fishing, and escaping reality with the occasional video game like Minecraft or Beat Saber.
- üå± Lately, I've spent a lot of time soaking up as much information as I can about API design patterns and best practices, building integrations with Azure Logic Apps for Jira/SharePoint, and using Power BI to get better data to help automate bookkeeping and payroll auditing for Renewed Wellness.  I also recently completed a course in applied data science through MIT Professional Education.  Among other things, the course focused on Python, machine learning, neural networks, recommendation systems, time series databases, data analysis and visualization with a strong emphasis on linear algebra, discreet mathematics, and statistics.  The programming aspect of the course was the easy part... I quickly realized how long it had been since I had taken a statistics class, though.  Thankfully, they make libraries and functions to help with that.  I'm also sharpening my skills on other languages, frameworks, patterns and methodologies.  Learning never ends.
- ü§ù While I'm not actively focusing on any specific side project, I'm always open to meeting and collaborating with others.  If something here has caught your attention, reach out!  I'd love to collaborate with someone on a few mechanical engineering/renewable energy ideas I've been mulling over for a while now and want to prototype, exploring automation projects for IoT applications, crypto and traditional asset performance analysis, machine learning/artificial intelligence applications, and distributed monitoring systems.  Really anything that is presented to me as interesting or with a fresh prespective.
